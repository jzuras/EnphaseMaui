# Enphase Local API Maui Blazor PWA Application
WARNING! This project was written entirely by Claude Code, with minimal review by me. Use at your own risk!

Unlike most of the other repos here, this one might prove useful, but only to the small
subset of developers who also own Envoy hardware from Enphase Energy.

This app was created to learn more about what Claude Code can do, 
and to learn how to create a cross-platform using Maui Blazor Hybrid and a PWA.
See my LinkedIn posts for more about this New Learning Journey project (link at bottom).

There is a separate ReadMeFromClaude.md file that contains the original readme file generated by Claude Code.
As such, it contains some hallucinations (claiming that this project
requires Node.js, for example), plus some structure issues and duplicated information.

This file is my own attempt to provide a need-to-know overview of the project.

This project is a MUAI/Blazor Hybrid app, plus a web app and PWA that displays data from the Enphase Local API, as shown in the screenshot above.
(I borrowed the interface design from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxUrxY4rw74) YouTube video about a very cool hardware version.

Also included is a console app that acts as a CORS proxy to allow the web app and PWA to access the local API,
and a separate OAuth app to obtain the token required to access the local API.

The display includes current production and consumption data, and the last updated time. This can
be updated manually (Now button) or automatically every 15, 30, or 60 seconds.

Even though I gave Claude Code an image file showing the interface, it added features on its own
from the earlier TUI project, simply because I included that project as reference code for it to use.
These additions are a Live Data setting, plus Panel Total and Efficiency values.
See my Part 5 LI post about that TUI project for more information about these (link at bottom).

The MAUI app can run on Windows and Android, and the PWA in Chrome and Edge (Firefox and DuckDuckGo
never recognized this as a PWA). In theory, the MAUI app can also run on Linux, iOS and MacOS, 
and the PWA on mobile browsers, but I have not tested these. 

Running as a regular Blazor app in the browser is available wherever browsers can run, but this
and the PWA require running the CORS proxy server to access the local API. 
(Accessing the CORS proxy would likely be an issue when running on mobile browsers.)

An important caveat regarding the PWA: it is set up to NOT hot-reload, because I always
ran it to test the PWA. This means a Ctrl-F5 is required to refresh the browser
after changes are made to the code. See the comments in the `wwwroot/service-worker.js` file to change this.

Accessing the Enphase Local API requires a token, which can be obtained by running the OAuth app.
The clipboard is used to manually move the token from the OAuth app to the MAUI app or PWA,
which is then stored in the browser's local storage for the PWA, or in the MAUI app's secure storage.

In addition to the ReadMeFromClaude.md file, there are other MD files created by Claude Code
when I asked it to generate documentation, which I expected to be helpful as context
for each session. I had to manually trim the Claude.md file after getting a size warning.
(I am still learning how best to create context docs for Claude Code.)

Both of these Enphase Energy documents were used to help Claude understand the local API,
and how to obtain the token required to access it:
